# SAUCE LABS
This project has quite a few drawbacks as far as quality is concerned.

1. Embedded code within the names and descriptions of the products, which can generate important security breaches.
2. The filters work correctly
3. When reviewing the description of the products you do not get sizes and the photos are not the best to display on a product page.
4. When positioning on the shopping cart icon the cursor does not perceive that it is a link that redirects us to another page.
5. The fields to type the information do not have validations when entering numbers in the fields of name and surname and letters in the field of zip code, leaving to continue with the flow without inconvenience.
6. The page of review of what is in the shopping cart in my opinion is repeated making the process more tedious for the user.
5. It does not have a clear confirmation of the purchase made, at no time requests an email to send information to track the order.

As a conclusion, it has quite a few UI flaws, its execution speed is high and there is not much waiting between loading screens.
